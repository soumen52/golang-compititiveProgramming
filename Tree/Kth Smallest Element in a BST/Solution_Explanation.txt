This problem is quite straight forward.

We have to just traverse through the binary search tree and get the result in inorder travarsel from .
So the traversal result will be in sorted.

Nothing else just found the kth element in the array . Done.

Happy coding.


Code complexity : O(n) to traverse the tree
Time Complexity : O(n) to keep the inorder list
